## Technical Specifications

Based on recent codebase improvements, the following technical specifications have been updated:

- **Frontend Refactoring:** The large `ClaubeDesign.tsx` component has been broken down into smaller, more manageable and reusable components.
- **Secure Secret Management:** Implementation now strictly adheres to using environment variables for sensitive data, removing hardcoded secrets.
- **Database Migrations:** Database schema changes are now managed via Umzug/sequelize-cli migrations, replacing `sequelize.sync()` for production safety.

---

## Technical Specifications

- **Routing:** react-router-dom with scroll sync
- **Animations:** Framer Motion, Lottie, CSS
- **3D Assets:** Optimized voxel models, SVGs, or lightweight GLTF
- **Styling:** CSS Grid + Flexbox, CSS Variables, media queries
- **Performance:** Lazy load assets, optimize images/animations
- **Security:** No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, secret scanning
- **Testing:** 100% coverage with Jest + React Testing Library
- **Accessibility:** WCAG compliance, keyboard navigation, alt text
- **Containerization:** Docker for consistent environments
- **CI/CD:** Automated pipelines with linting, testing, deployment
- **Monitoring:** Logging, analytics, performance metrics
